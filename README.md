# Pharmacy Pre-Check Verification Agent

The **simplest** way to set up and assit your pharmacy data entry verification system! This program watches your screen for the "Pre-Check Rx" pharmacy software (PioneerRx) and helps verify that the information entered matches the source document. It places colored boxes over fields to show you if they match (green) or don't match (red). And in YOLO mode it can even automatically send a key press (F12 by default for PRx) to advance to the next prescription when all fields are green!

This app is built with the PioneeRx pharmacy dispensing software, if you use a differnt software and need help adapting this app to your setup, please feel free to reach out or customize to your keyword trigger! The concet of precheck verification for data entry accuracy shall be the same or very similar regardless of the software you use.

**üöÄ EASY SETUP:** Use the simple launcher to get started with both the coordinate setup GUI and web monitoring interface!


## How It Works

This program monitors the selected screen area for the "Pre-Check Rx" keyword trigger. Once detects, it will performs the following tasks:
1. read the data entered patient name, prescriber name, drug name, and directions/sig from the selected screen regions
2. compare the entered data against the source document. This is desgined for standard eRx format where the source info are in the fixed locations. 
3. give a matching score for each field based on the similarity of the entered data and the source document (in a very smart way)
4. display colored boxes over the fields to indicate matches (green) or mismatches (red), the passing rate is cutomizable by the user
5. optionally, a YOLO (you only live once) mode will automatically send a key press (F12 by default) to autopilot the process

## Fancy skill to make it "smart"
### üßπ Smart Text Cleaning & Normalization

- **Name Format Normalization**: Automatically converts between "Last, First" and "First Last" formats for accurate patient name comparison
- **Patient Middle Name Handling**: Intelligently matches names with or without middle names/initials (e.g., "John M Smith" matches "John Smith")
- **Prescriber Title Cleaning**: Removes professional titles and suffixes (Dr., MD, PharmD, etc.) from prescriber names for consistent comparison
- **Smart Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation, normalizes spacing, and handles case differences for consistent comparisons

### üíä Pharmacy-Specific Intelligence

- **Comprehensive Sig Abbreviation Expansion**: Automatically expands common pharmacy abbreviations:
  - **Frequency**: bid ‚Üí twice daily, tid ‚Üí three times daily, qid ‚Üí four times daily
  - **Route**: po ‚Üí by mouth, sl ‚Üí sublingual, IM ‚Üí intramuscular  
  - **Timing**: ac ‚Üí before meals, pc ‚Üí after meals, hs ‚Üí at bedtime
  - **Quantity**: q4h ‚Üí every 4 hours, prn ‚Üí as needed
  - **And many more** - handles dozens of standard pharmacy abbreviations
- **Enhanced Drug Name Matching**: Advanced semantic matching for drug names with:
  - **Release formulations**: ER (Extended Release), DR (Delayed Release), XR, LA, SA, SR, CR, etc.
  - **Dosage forms**: TAB (Tablet), CAP (Capsule), TBEC (Tablet Delayed Release), etc.
  - **Administration routes**: PO (By Mouth), IV (Intravenous), IM (Intramuscular), etc.
  - **Common pharmacy terms**: DISP (Dispense), SIG (Directions), PRN (As Needed), etc.
  - **Brand name patterns**: HCL (Hydrochloride), HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide), etc.
  - **Multiple matching strategies**: Direct fuzzy matching, token sort ratio, partial matching, and core drug name matching
  - **Easy maintenance**: Add custom abbreviations through external JSON configuration file
- **Flexible Sig Matching**: Accounts for different ways pharmacies express the same directions
- **Route Normalization**: Handles variations in administration routes (oral/po/by mouth)

#### Drug Name Abbreviation Management

The system includes an extensive pharmaceutical abbreviation system that's completely externalized for easy maintenance:

**Easy Updates Method:**
1. Edit `abbreviations.json` in the same folder as the main script
2. Add your custom abbreviations in this format:
```json
{
    " er ": " extended release ",
    " dr ": " delayed release ",
    " tbec ": " tablet delayed release ",
    " your_custom_abbr ": " your expansion "
}
```

**All abbreviations are now managed externally** - no code editing required! The system loads all pharmaceutical abbreviations from `abbreviations.json` at startup, including:
- Release formulations (ER, DR, XR, LA, etc.)
- Dosage forms (TAB, CAP, TBEC, etc.)  
- Administration routes (PO, IV, IM, etc.)
- Frequency terms (BID, TID, QID, etc.)
- Common pharmacy abbreviations and brand names

**Important formatting rules:**
- Include spaces around abbreviations (e.g., `" er "` not `"er"`)
- Use lowercase for both abbreviations and expansions
- The spaces ensure word boundary matching

**Advanced Drug Name Matching Features:** (this is the most time comsuming part of the program)
- **Preserves dosage information** (5mg, 10ml, etc.) as it's critical for drug identification - metformin 500mg ‚â† metformin 1000mg
- **Strict dosage validation**: Different dosages are treated as different medications to prevent dispensing errors
- **Smart salt form handling**: 
  - Normalizes equivalent forms (hydrochloride ‚Üî hcl) for better matching
  - Maintains distinct salts as separate drugs (metoprolol tartrate ‚â† metoprolol succinate)
  - Distinguishes release formulations (IR ‚â† ER ‚â† SR ‚â† XR)
- **Enhanced matching strategies with weighted prioritization**:
  - **Primary drug name matching** (first word gets highest weight for pharmaceutical accuracy)
  - Direct fuzzy matching (weighted higher for exact matches)
  - Token sort ratio (handles word order differences)
  - Token set ratio (handles extra words, weighted lower to reduce false positives)
  - Partial ratio (handles subsets, weighted lower)
  - **Dosage mismatch detection**: Automatically flags when dosages don't match
  - **Salt form validation**: Identifies incompatible salt combinations

**Testing Your Changes:**
- Restart the application to load new abbreviations
- Check console output for confirmation that custom abbreviations were loaded
- Use the OCR testing features in the GUI to verify improvements

### üéØ Advanced Matching Logic

- **Flexible Matching**: Uses a 75%+ similarity threshold to account for minor OCR differences and typos
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Different cleaning rules for names vs. drug names vs. directions
- **Adaptive Timing**: Responds quickly to screen changes (0.1s) and slows down when screen is static to save CPU
- **Prescription Change Detection**: Automatically detects when you move to a new prescription and re-runs verification

---

## General Settings Configuration

Both the GUI and command-line tools now allow you to configure general program settings:

### Matching Thresholds

Control how strict the text matching is for each field type:

- **Patient Name Threshold** (default: 75%): How similar patient names must be to consider a match
- **Prescriber Name Threshold** (default: 75%): How similar prescriber names must be to consider a match  
- **Drug Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar drug names must be to consider a match
- **Directions/Sig Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar directions must be to consider a match

**Higher values** = More strict matching (fewer false positives, but might miss valid matches)
**Lower values** = More lenient matching (might catch more matches, but could have false positives)

### Automation Settings

Configure what happens when all fields match:

- **Enable/Disable Automation**: Whether to automatically send a key when all fields are green
- **Key to Send**: Which key to press (F1-F12, Enter, Tab, Space, Escape)
- **Delay**: How long to wait (in seconds) before sending the key

**Example Use Cases:**
- Set key to "F12" to automatically advance to the next prescription
- Set key to "Enter" to automatically submit the form
- Set delay to 1.0s to give time to visually confirm before advancing

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH" Error

If you see this error, it means the program can't find your Tesseract installation. Try these solutions:

**Option 1: Add Tesseract to your system PATH**
1. Find where Tesseract was installed (usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`). Please make sure you installed it with admin credentials and selected "install for all users".
2. Add this path to your Windows PATH environment variable:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the Tesseract installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
   - Click "OK" on all windows
3. Restart your Command Prompt and try running the program again

**Option 2: Create a local tesseract folder (if Option 1 doesn't work)**
1. In your project folder, create a new folder named `tesseract`
2. Copy `tesseract.exe` and the `tessdata` folder from your Tesseract installation directory to this new folder
3. Your project should then look like this:
   ```
   HayatPrecheck-main/
   |-- tesseract/
   |   |-- tesseract.exe
   |   |-- tessdata/
   |-- Precheck_OCR.py
   |-- settings_gui.py
   |-- settings_cli.py
   |-- launcher.py
   |-- start.bat
   |-- config.json
   |-- requirements.txt
   |-- README.md
   ```

### "GUI won't start"
- Make sure you have Python with tkinter: `python -c "import tkinter"`
- On some Linux systems: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

### "Web interface won't open"
- Try: `python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 8501
- Try `http://127.0.0.1:8501` or `http://localhost:8501` instead
- Streamlit runs on http, not https by default. Please ignore all safety warnings from your browser.

### "OCR not working"
- Install Tesseract: Download from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
- Windows: Add to PATH or put in project folder

### Program Shows Red/Green Boxes in Wrong Locations

This means the coordinate regions need adjustment for your specific setup. **Use the coordinate adjustment tools to fix this easily!**

**Option 1: Use the Interactive Settings Tool (Recommended)**
1. Run the settings GUI tool:
   ```
   python settings_gui.py
   ```
2. The tool will open with a screenshot of your desktop
3. First, set up the trigger region:
   - Select "trigger" from the dropdown
   - Click and drag around the "Pre-Check Rx" text or any reliable text in the window
4. Then, for each field (patient_name, prescriber_name, drug_name, direction_sig):
   - Select the field from the dropdown
   - Choose "Entered" for left panel fields or "Source" for right panel fields
   - Click and drag to draw a rectangle around the text area
   - The coordinates will be automatically updated
5. Click "Save Configuration" when done
6. Run the main program again to test

**Option 2: Manual Troubleshooting**
1. **Check Window Position**: Note the exact position and size of your pharmacy software window
2. **Use Command-Line Helper**: Run `python settings_cli.py show` to see current coordinates
3. **Test Individual Regions**: Use the settings GUI's "Test OCR" feature to verify each region
4. **Adjust as Needed**: The program adapts to any screen resolution and window configuration

## üìà Future Improvements - My favorite part

1. With my nVIDIA DGX reservation, I'm planning a **centralized architecture** with GPU-accelerated OCR and AI-powered semantic matching for even better accuracy while maintaining complete privacy and HIPAA compliance. The vision is a single powerful computer with a highly customized for pharmacy local AI model serving multiple pharmacies.
2. By using paddleOCR with **nVIDIA CUDA**, I can leverage the GPU for much faster and more accurate OCR processing compared to CPU-bound Tesseract. Also PaddleOCR supports **training custom models**, which opens the door for pharmacy-specific OCR models that can handle common fonts, layouts, and artifacts seen in prescriptions. This could significantly improve text recognition accuracy.
3. The knowledge base of current local LLM will provide the best drug name and sig **semantic matching**, replacing the hardcoded string matching logic with a more flexible and intelligent approach.
4. New opensource LLM models are coming out every month, and with the right fine-tuning and prompt engineering, I believe we can achieve very high accuracy for drug name and sig matching while keeping everything local and private.

**Central Processing Hub Vision:**
- **One Powerful Machine**: A dedicated high-performance computer with enterprise-grade GPU serving multiple pharmacy locations
- **Network-Based Service**: All pharmacies connect to the central hub for processing, eliminating the need for individual high-end workstations
- **Scalable Architecture**: One central system can handle OCR and verification requests from dozens of pharmacy workstations simultaneously
- **Cost-Effective**: Replace multiple individual CPU-limited systems with one shared powerful GPU machine
- **Centralized Management**: Single point of configuration, updates, model training and maintenance for all connected pharmacies

**Hardware Requirements:**

**Current System (CPU-Based per Pharmacy Station):**
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, modern CPU for basic OCR processing per workstation
- **Limitation**: CPU-intensive Tesseract OCR, hardcoded text matching, requires individual setup at each location, rate limited by the computer's CPU power

**Future System (Centralized GPU Hub):**
- **Central Hub Minimum**: 32GB RAM, RTX 5070+ for serving 5-10 pharmacy workstations
- **Central Hub Recommended**: 64GB RAM, RTX 5090 for serving 15-25 pharmacy workstations  
- **Central Hub Optimal**: 128GB+ RAM, DGX/H100 for serving 50+ pharmacy workstations
- **Pharmacy Workstations**: Basic computers with network connectivity - no special hardware required
- **Network Infrastructure**: Reliable high-speed internet connection between pharmacies and central hub

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Centralized PaddleOCR)**: convert to PaddleOCR for GPU-based OCR processing,build initial central hub prototype
- **Phase 1.5 (Local LLM Integration)**: build local LLM for semantic drug name and sig matching, replacing hardcoded logic
- **Phase 2 (Network Architecture)**: Develop secure API system for pharmacy workstations to communicate with central hub
- **Phase 3 (AI Semantic Analysis)**: Replace hardcoded string matching with LLM-based semantic understanding on the central system with prompt engineering
- **Phase 3.5 (Local LLM Training)**: Fine-tune local LLM on pharmacy-specific data for better accuracy
- **Phase 4 (Multi-Pharmacy Integration)**: Scale to support dozens of pharmacy locations from single central hub
- **Phase 5 (Enterprise Features)**: Add centralized reporting, analytics, and management across all connected pharmacies
- This represents an evolution from individual pharmacy systems to a centralized service architecture
- Community feedback and pilot testing with pharmacy chains will guide development priorities
- Maintain backward compatibility with current individual pharmacy installations

**Why This Centralized Approach:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: One powerful machine replaces dozens of individual high-end workstations
- **Performance**: Enterprise-grade GPU processing delivers consistent high-speed OCR for all connected pharmacies
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new pharmacy locations without additional hardware investments
