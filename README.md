# Pharmacy Pre-Check Verification Agent

The **simplest** way to set up and monitor your pharmacy verification system! This program watches your screen for the "Pre-Check Rx" pharmacy software and helps verify that the information entered matches the source document. It places colored boxes over fields to show you if they match (green) or don't match (red).

**üöÄ EASY SETUP:** Use the simple launcher to get started with both the coordinate setup GUI and web monitoring interface!

## üéØ Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: Super Easy Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python launcher.py
```
**Or double-click:** `start.bat` (Windows)

Choose option 3 to launch both the setup GUI and monitoring interface!

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. **Set up coordinates:** `python settings_gui.py`
2. **Monitor system:** `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## üìñ What You Get

- **üõ†Ô∏è Easy Setup GUI**: Drag and drop to select screen regions
- **üåê Web Monitoring**: Modern dashboard accessible from any device
- **üì± Mobile Access**: Check status from your phone or tablet
- **üìä Real-time Analytics**: Performance metrics and accuracy tracking
- **üîç Live OCR Testing**: Verify your setup immediately

## üéØ Why This Approach?

| Feature | This System | Complex Solutions |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | ‚úÖ Drag & drop GUI | ‚ùå Manual coordinates |
| **Monitoring** | ‚úÖ Web dashboard | ‚ùå Command line only |
| **Mobile Access** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **User Friendly** | ‚úÖ Very easy | ‚ùå Technical |
| **Reliability** | ‚úÖ Proven GUI + modern web | ‚ùå Experimental |

## How It Works

The program automatically handles common differences between the entered data and source documents:

- **Name Format Normalization**: The left side shows names as "Last, First" while the right side shows "First Last" - the program automatically converts both to the same format for accurate comparison
- **Pharmacy Abbreviation Expansion**: Common pharmacy abbreviations (po, bid, tid, etc.) are expanded for better matching
- **Smart Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation and normalizes spacing for consistent comparisons
- **Flexible Matching**: Uses a 65% similarity threshold to account for minor OCR differences and typos
- **Adaptive Timing**: Responds quickly to screen changes (0.1s) and slows down when screen is static to save CPU
- **Prescription Change Detection**: Automatically detects when you move to a new prescription and re-runs verification

---

## General Settings Configuration

Both the GUI and command-line tools now allow you to configure general program settings:

### Matching Thresholds

Control how strict the text matching is for each field type:

- **Patient Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar patient names must be to consider a match
- **Prescriber Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar prescriber names must be to consider a match  
- **Drug Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar drug names must be to consider a match
- **Directions/Sig Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar directions must be to consider a match

**Higher values** = More strict matching (fewer false positives, but might miss valid matches)
**Lower values** = More lenient matching (might catch more matches, but could have false positives)

### Automation Settings

Configure what happens when all fields match:

- **Enable/Disable Automation**: Whether to automatically send a key when all fields are green
- **Key to Send**: Which key to press (F1-F12, Enter, Tab, Space, Escape)
- **Delay**: How long to wait (in seconds) before sending the key

**Example Use Cases:**
- Set key to "F12" to automatically advance to the next prescription
- Set key to "Enter" to automatically submit the form
- Set delay to 1.0s to give time to visually confirm before advancing

### "tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH" Error

If you see this error, it means the program can't find your Tesseract installation. Try these solutions:

**Option 1: Add Tesseract to your system PATH**
1. Find where Tesseract was installed (usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`)
2. Add this path to your Windows PATH environment variable:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add the Tesseract installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`)
   - Click "OK" on all windows
3. Restart your Command Prompt and try running the program again

### Program Shows Red/Green Boxes in Wrong Locations

This means the coordinate regions need adjustment for your specific setup. **Use the coordinate adjustment tools to fix this easily!**

**Option 1: Use the Interactive Settings Tool (Recommended)**
1. Run the settings GUI tool:
   ```
   python settings_gui.py
   ```
2. The tool will open with a screenshot of your desktop
3. First, set up the trigger region:
   - Select "trigger" from the dropdown
   - Click and drag around the "Pre-Check Rx" text or any reliable text in the window
4. Then, for each field (patient_name, prescriber_name, drug_name, direction_sig):
   - Select the field from the dropdown
   - Choose "Entered" for left panel fields or "Source" for right panel fields
   - Click and drag to draw a rectangle around the text area
   - The coordinates will be automatically updated
5. Click "Save Configuration" when done
6. Run the main program again to test

**Option 2: Manual Troubleshooting**
1. **Check Window Position**: Note the exact position and size of your pharmacy software window
2. **Use Command-Line Helper**: Run `python settings_cli.py show` to see current coordinates
3. **Test Individual Regions**: Use the settings GUI's "Test OCR" feature to verify each region
4. **Adjust as Needed**: The program adapts to any screen resolution and window configuration

**Option 2: Create a local tesseract folder (if Option 1 doesn't work)**
1. In your project folder, create a new folder named `tesseract`
2. Copy `tesseract.exe` and the `tessdata` folder from your Tesseract installation directory to this new folder
3. Your project should then look like this:
   ```
   HayatPrecheck-main/
   |-- tesseract/
   |   |-- tesseract.exe
   |   |-- tessdata/
   |-- Precheck_OCR.py
   |-- settings_gui.py
   |-- settings_cli.py
   |-- launcher.sh
   |-- launcher.bat
   |-- config.json
   |-- requirements.txt
   |-- README.md
   ```

## üìà Future Improvements

We're planning GPU-accelerated OCR and AI-powered semantic matching for even better accuracy while maintaining complete privacy and HIPAA compliance. All processing will remain local to your machine.
- **Future Setup**: Dedicated high-performance PC with strong GPU specifically for pharmacy automation
- **Deployment**: Central powerful machine can serve multiple pharmacy workstations via network
- **Cost-Effective**: One powerful GPU machine can replace multiple CPU-limited workstations

**Hardware Requirements:**

**Current System (CPU-Based):**
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, modern CPU for basic OCR processing
- **Limitation**: CPU-intensive Tesseract OCR, hardcoded text matching

**Future System (GPU-Accelerated):**
- **Minimum**: 16GB RAM, RTX 4060 or better for PaddleOCR + basic LLM
- **Recommended**: 32GB RAM, RTX 4070+ for real-time vision-language processing  
- **Optimal**: 64GB+ RAM, RTX 4090 or professional GPU for multiple simultaneous workstations
- **Purpose-Built**: Dedicated automation PC with high-end GPU serving entire pharmacy

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (PaddleOCR)**: Replace Tesseract with GPU-accelerated OCR for immediate performance gains
- **Phase 2 (Semantic Analysis)**: Replace hardcoded string matching with LLM-based semantic understanding
- **Phase 3 (Integration)**: Combine vision and language models for comprehensive pharmacy automation
- This represents a significant evolution from CPU-limited to GPU-powered intelligent systems
- Community feedback and pilot testing in pharmacy environments will guide development priorities
- Maintain backward compatibility with current CPU-based system for existing installations

**Why This Approach:**
- **Performance**: GPU processing is 10-100x faster than CPU for vision tasks
- **Accuracy**: Semantic understanding vs. rigid text matching reduces false positives/negatives
- **Scalability**: One powerful machine can serve multiple pharmacy workstations
- **Future-Proof**: Built for the next generation of AI-powered pharmacy automation
