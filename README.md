# Pharmacy Pre-Check Verification Agent

The **simplest** way to set up and monitor your pharmacy verification system! This program watches your screen for the "Pre-Check Rx" pharmacy software and helps verify that the information entered matches the source document. It places colored boxes over fields to show you if they match (green) or don't match (red).

This app is built with the PioneeRx pharmacy dispensing software, if you use a differnt software and need help adapting this app to your setup, please feel free to reach out! The concet of precheck verification for data entry accuracy shall be the same or very similar regardless of the software you use.

**üöÄ EASY SETUP:** Use the simple launcher to get started with both the coordinate setup GUI and web monitoring interface!

## üéØ Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: Super Easy Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python launcher.py
```
**Or double-click:** `start.bat` (Windows)

Choose option 3 to launch both the setup GUI and monitoring interface!

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. **Set up coordinates:** `python settings_gui.py`
2. **Monitor system:** `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## üìñ What You Get

- **üõ†Ô∏è Easy Setup GUI**: Drag and drop to select screen regions
- **üåê Web Monitoring**: Modern dashboard accessible from any device

## üéØ Why This Approach?

| Feature | This System | Complex Solutions |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | ‚úÖ Drag & drop GUI | ‚ùå Manual coordinates |
| **Monitoring** | ‚úÖ Web dashboard | ‚ùå Command line only |
| **User Friendly** | ‚úÖ At best effort | ‚ùå Technical |
| **Reliability** | ‚úÖ Proven GUI + modern web | ‚ùå Experimental |

## How It Works

The program automatically handles common differences between the entered data and source documents:

- **Name Format Normalization**: The left side shows names as "Last, First" while the right side shows "First Last" - the program automatically converts both to the same format for accurate comparison
- **Pharmacy Abbreviation Expansion**: Common pharmacy abbreviations (po, bid, tid, etc.) are expanded for better matching
- **Smart Text Cleaning**: Removes punctuation and normalizes spacing for consistent comparisons
- **Flexible Matching**: Uses a 65% similarity threshold to account for minor OCR differences and typos
- **Adaptive Timing**: Responds quickly to screen changes (0.1s) and slows down when screen is static to save CPU
- **Prescription Change Detection**: Automatically detects when you move to a new prescription and re-runs verification

## Coordinate Adjustment Tools

**üéØ FLEXIBILITY:** The program works with any screen resolution, window size, or pharmacy software layout. Use these tools to configure the regions for your specific setup - no need to change your monitor resolution or window configuration!

The program includes two tools for adjusting screen coordinates and general settings when the default configuration doesn't work for your setup:

### Enhanced GUI Tool (Recommended)

**File:** `settings_gui.py`

A comprehensive graphical tool with advanced features for both coordinate adjustment and general settings:

```bash
python settings_gui.py
```

**Features:**
- **Visual Interface**: See your desktop screenshot with overlay rectangles
- **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag to define regions visually
- **Real-time Preview**: See coordinate changes immediately
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out for precise adjustment (View menu)
- **OCR Testing**: Test selected regions to verify text detection
- **Configuration Management**: Import/export settings, manual backups available
- **Validation**: Check all regions for potential issues
- **Auto-Save**: Optionally save changes automatically
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+S to save, F5 for new screenshot
- **General Settings**: Configure matching thresholds and automation options

**Usage:**
1. Run the tool and take a screenshot of your pharmacy software
2. Select "trigger" first and drag around the "Pre-Check Rx" text
3. For each field, select the field name and region type
4. Drag rectangles around the appropriate text areas
5. Use "Test OCR" to verify the selection captures text correctly
6. Adjust general settings like matching thresholds and automation options
7. Save configuration when complete

**Requirements:** 
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- If GUI doesn't work, install with: `brew install python-tk` (macOS)

### Command-Line Tool (Fallback)

**File:** `settings_cli.py`

A simple command-line tool for when the GUI is not available:

```bash
# View current coordinates
python settings_cli.py show

# Edit specific field coordinates
python settings_cli.py edit patient_name entered

# Validate all coordinates
python settings_cli.py validate

# Create backup (manual - when needed)
python settings_cli.py backup

# View current settings
python settings_cli.py settings show

# Adjust matching thresholds
python settings_cli.py settings set threshold patient 70
python settings_cli.py settings set threshold drug 80

# Configure automation
python settings_cli.py settings set automation enable
python settings_cli.py settings set automation key f11
python settings_cli.py settings set automation delay 1.0
```

**Features:**
- Works in any terminal environment
- View and edit coordinates manually
- View and modify general settings (thresholds, automation)
- Validation and backup functions
- No GUI dependencies required

---

## General Settings Configuration

Both the GUI and command-line tools now allow you to configure general program settings:

### Matching Thresholds

Control how strict the text matching is for each field type:

- **Patient Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar patient names must be to consider a match
- **Prescriber Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar prescriber names must be to consider a match  
- **Drug Name Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar drug names must be to consider a match
- **Directions/Sig Threshold** (default: 65%): How similar directions must be to consider a match

**Higher values** = More strict matching (fewer false positives, but might miss valid matches)
**Lower values** = More lenient matching (might catch more matches, but could have false positives)

### Automation Settings

Configure what happens when all fields match:

- **Enable/Disable Automation**: Whether to automatically send a key when all fields are green
- **Key to Send**: Which key to press (F1-F12, Enter, Tab, Space, Escape)
- **Delay**: How long to wait (in seconds) before sending the key

**Example Use Cases:**
- Set key to "F12" to automatically advance to the next prescription
- Set key to "Enter" to automatically submit the form
- Set delay to 1.0s to give time to visually confirm before advancing
